    <div id="about-me">
      <p>Growing up I loved learning how things worked and that has driven a lot of what I do in life. Through high school, I was obsessed with cars and eventually aerospace engineering. After graduating high school, I started down that path when a co-worker introduced me to programming. I went through Devmountain's web dev bootcamp and found I loved not only understanding how computers work, but also that I could make them do some amazing things. I relish any opportunity to continue to foster that love and knowledge!</p>
      <p>When I'm not working on coding projects you can usually find me gaming, bingeing shows and movies with my wife, riding my motorcycle, or out in the garage practicing woodworking. I love the outdoors and love to get out any time I can. Currently, I'm also doing a night school program through BYU-Idaho to continue my education in the computer world!</p>
