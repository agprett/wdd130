      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The overall purpose of this site is to help new dungeon masters learn how to run sessions. The point of the home page will be a walk through of everything that goes into it. I think it will have an overview of what dnd is for the first paragraph. It will talk about the different aspects of storylines, campaigns, roleplaying and combat. 
        Working out a storyline of what generally is going on in the fantasy world can come from pre-generated stories or completely homemade stories, called homebrew, and both can be amazing. What makes it great is the thought and work that goes into it. If you don’t have a good session or are having problems with interaction, it is probably because the story isn’t motivating enough. Each character needs to be involved, whether they are following along to save the world, gain power to help destroy it, or just get by day to day. It is important to develop and add to the story as you go, keeping things interesting and adding new challenges. A lot of time is usually spent playing how to help the party proceed, whether that’s to a large end goal taking weeks, or small scale things taking only a couple hours. This site will help you plan good storylines and make sure players can engage.
        Roleplaying is a huge part of dnd. If you want players and others to be invested in the storylines, roleplaying as their characters is a great way. Each person’s character will be incredibly different, from motivations to personality to looks. Allowing players to dive into this can be a lot of fun and giving plenty of opportunity for it is important. As fun as the combat side of dnd is, without good roleplay, nothing will have an actual effect on players. This also greatly applies to the dm and the NPC’s. These random people and creatures that players interact with need to have varying personalities so it doesn’t feel like they are talking to the same person who just shapeshifts to look different. Keeping track of all of this can be difficult and that’s what this site will help with.
        Combat, while not as difficult to plan, can be the most difficult thing to keep track of, Making sure to balance the enemies your players face so they don’t feel underwhelmed or get instantly killed is difficult. The DM also has to keep track of the health, attacks, effects and positions of everything that is fighting. As you hopefully understand, it can be difficult to manage that and that is the major purpose of this site. On the planning page, you will find everything you need to track all of this information and more!

      </ul>
      <h3>Guide</h3>
      <p>
        The point of this guide page is to walk through tips and tricks to creating memorable campaigns including information from DND guidebooks and veteran players and hopefully being able to answer any questions that might come up. This will walk through how to plan out storylines as a whole for the first part. It will explain what makes good storylines and characters for the players to interact with and make their own!
        The second part of this will walk through planning out for individual sessions. This means planning events that may occur during a single meeting. Prepping characters, maps and events that will occur over the time of play can be difficult because a single choice the party makes can through everything off, so this will be all about how to be prepared for things like that and how to keep the party going toward their major goals, while still being able to leave their mark in this fantasy world.
        The last part of this will be about specifically how to plan combat. It will have guides for how to choose what type,  amount and strength of the enemies your party can fight. It will also have a large list of enemies you can use and add to each encounter and any information you might need about them.

      <h3>Planning</h3>
      <p>
        The planning page will primarily be used to track all of the information needed for combat. It will have representations for each creature. With this you will have an extensive list of information on health, attacks, skills, and more that you will need to be able to make sure encounters go as smoothly as possible. It will be interactive so as needed creatures can be added or removed, all to make sure dm’s have to memorize as little as possible.
