      <p>Dungeons and dragons is an amazing and complex game. It can be incredible to play, when done correctly. It is played by in a group, usually a minimum of 3, with two roles. Most people will be players, who create their own character and work through a cmpaign or quest as that character. The other role is just one person, the dungeon master or DM, whose job is to plan out and guide the players as they work through the quest. The DM acts as the non-player characters(NPC's) and enemies, helps the party move forward in the quest and is in charge of the game overall. Both roles have a lot of information and planning that goes into playing the game. The goal of this site is to give a walkthrough for DM's on how to conduct successful sessions and campaigns and help keep track of information about the world the players characters live in. This site will not be as helpful for players, but there are many resources for them like DnD Beyond, Adventurers Codex, and many more!</p>

      <p>Actually playing DnD is a bit complex, and is explained a lot more on the guide page, which both players and DM's will find helpful. The basics of the game is the DM will lay out a scene or scenario and then the players will act as they think their characters would. They will roll dice as needed to see if they succeed or fail and to what extent, then the DM will explain what happened as a result of those actions. Prior to starting, the DM will have picked or created a campaign, or storyline the characters will walk through. This can be quick stories taking an hour or two being completed in a single session, or long chronicles taking weeks of sessions to complete. Ahead of each meeting, or session, the DM should plan out generally the goals they want the party to work through. That is what will be actually done during each session around the table!</p>
